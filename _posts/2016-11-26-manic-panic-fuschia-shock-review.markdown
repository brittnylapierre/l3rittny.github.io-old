<p>It's winter now and I'm experimenting with berry-purple-pink colours!</p>

<p>I died my hair with Joico's Rose semi-permanent dye for Halloween. Oh god was that stuff ever horrible. The colour was a pale pink which was good since that's what I wanted but it washed out super fast leaving my hair peach coloured, which I don't mind. The main problem with the dye is that for some reason they decided to put glitter in it. GLITTER!! -_- Why would they do that? They were large enough flakes that it wouldn't just make my hair look shiny either. Man, there was glitter everywhere for days after I dyed it.</p>

<p>Anyways once that faded out I was left with yellow blonde-peach hair. I had some leftover Manic Panic in the colour Fuschia Shock from when I dyed my hair last winter so I decided to use it. I didn't have much left so I mixed it with conditioner. The result was a really vibrant (like a highlighter) dark pink, it was really nice!  It was lighter than I remembered from last year though, the reason for that was because I mixed it with conditioner. </p>

<p>After about two weeks it started to fade and got kind of dull so I bought another jar and put it straight on my hair. This brand of dye, no matter the colour but especially for the pinks and reds, leaks everywhere for the first week or so when you don't mix it with conditioner! My bathtub gets temporarily stained from it, and usually, my neck gets a little tinted even when I'm trying to be careful. T.T The colour payoff is amazing though if you're looking for seriously vivid colour.</p>

<p>Manic panic definitely comes off onto your hands in the shower! Either wash your hands often or wear gloves to prevent this from happening. I also flip my hair up over my forehead and keep my head down while in the shower so the dye doesn't run down my back and stain it. Also, I usually squeeze most of the water out of my hair before I leave the bathtub, and then immediately cover my hair with an old t-shirt I don't care about. This prevents the dye from dripping all over the place in my house or staining my skin. You only have to do this for the first week or two, though!</p>

<p>If you're looking for a semi-permanent dye that doesn't last quite so long as Manic Panic but leaks less and is less hassle, check out the Ion Colour Brilliance line. I've used their fuschia colour, and an awesome colour called Rose Quartz, and both times I didn't have to worry too much about the dye staining my nail or hands in the shower.</p>
