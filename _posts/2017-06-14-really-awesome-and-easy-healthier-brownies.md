<p>Recipe first, ramble later.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup peanut flour</li>
  <li>1/2 cup vanilla Vega One or any other protein powder</li>
  <l1>3-5 Tbsp Cocao Powder</li>
  <li>2Tbsp flour of choice</li>
  <li>6 packets of stevia powder (6 grams) (you can add more or less if you want to adjust the sweetness)</li>
  <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
  <li>1/2 Tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 cup milk or milk subsitute of choice (or even water if you don't have anything)<l/i>
  <li>1 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1 tsp honey</li>
  <li>1 tsp warmed coconut oil or "mana" (blended coconut - soooo good)</li>
</ul>

<p>1. Preheat oven to 350F.</p>
<p>2. Combine the dry ingredients first, making sure that you get and many of the clumps out of the peanut flour as you can.</p>
<p>3. Make a hole in the center (shove everything off to the sides) and pour in your 1 cup of milk, then the vinilla, honey, and coconut oil</p>
<p>4. Mix the wet incredients in until you get a consitency that's not as wet as browney batter but not as dry as a paste. Somewhere in between is perfect.</p>
<p>5. Put parchment paper down in a 9x9 inch pan (or grease the pan) and squish your mixture into it.</p>
<p>6. Put it in the oven for 20-25 minutes then let it cool until you cant wait any longer!</p>
